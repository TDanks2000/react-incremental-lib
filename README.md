## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Each hook is designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind. Here are a few usage examples:

### üîÑ Game Loop (`useGameLoop`)

Runs a function at a fixed FPS to handle frame-based updates.

```
import { useGameLoop } from "react-incremental-lib";

useGameLoop({
  fps: 60,
  update: () => console.log("Game loop running!"),
});
```

---

### üñ±Ô∏è Clicker (`useClicker`)

Manages a click-based resource.

```
import { useClicker } from "react-incremental-lib";

const { count, handleClick } = useClicker({
  onClick: (val) => console.log("Clicked!", val)
});
```

---

### üéñÔ∏è Achievements (`useAchievement`)

Tracks when a condition is met and unlocks achievements.

```
import { useAchievement } from "react-incremental-lib";

const { unlocked } = useAchievement({
  name: "First Click",
  condition: clicks >= 1,
  onUnlock: () => console.log("Unlocked!")
});
```

---

### üîº Auto-Increment (`useAutoIncrement`)

Increases currency automatically over time.

```
import { useAutoIncrement } from "react-incremental-lib";

const { pause, resume, isPaused } = useAutoIncrement({
  interval: 1000,
  increaseBy: 5,
  onAutoIncrement: (amount) => console.log(`Gained ${amount}!`)
});
```

---

### üí∞ Resource Cap (`useResourceCap`)

Prevents resources from exceeding a maximum limit.

```
import { useResourceCap } from "react-incremental-lib";

const { resource, addResource, removeResource } = useResourceCap({
  initialValue: 50,
  max: 100
});
```

---

### üí§ Idle Progress (`useIdleProgress`)

Rewards players for time spent away.

```
import { useIdleProgress } from "react-incremental-lib";

const { idleGain } = useIdleProgress({ resourcePerSecond: 2 });
console.log(`You gained ${idleGain} resources while away!`);
```
